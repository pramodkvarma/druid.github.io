I spoke to Money2020 team Elena Mesropyan from EU and Rachel Morrissey from USA on how Aadhaar and India Stack enabled India to compress 4 decade long cycle to less than a decade to achieve population scale transformation.

But how does one go about designing and building a system of such scale, counting users not in millions but billions? We spoke to Pramod Varma, the Chief Architect of Aadhaar and UPI, to discuss the thinking behind redesigning a digital economy.
