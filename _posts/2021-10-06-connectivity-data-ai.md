I am speaking at [Western Balkans digital summit](https://event.digitalsummitwb2021.com/event/digital-summit-western-balkans) on an important topic. This is a brief talk before the [panel discussion](https://event.digitalsummitwb2021.com/event/digital-summit-western-balkans/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfNjU1NTU2) session. Following is my speech text.

Connectivity, data, and AI, all of which will have an unimaginable impact on society.

Hello! I am Pramod Varma, Chief Architect of India’s digital ID program and architect of India Stack touching a billion people in India. I am pleased to be speaking with all of you today on this important topic!

In the last two decades the world saw unprecedented growth in data resulting from increased connectivity, mobiles, and cloud computing. Today, there are more than 6 Billion smartphone users in the world, connectivity is fast becoming ubiquitous, digitization and virtualization of our life seems inevitable! 

AI and Deep learning algorithms have seen a nonlinear improvement in the last 3-4 years. AI is not necessarily about human looking robots as we see in movies, it will be way more subtle and invisible! It will be everywhere and in everything we do. 

Low cost sensors, 5G, combined with cheap storage and compute will further accelerate this trend. Domestic and cross border trade, skilling and job opportunities, access to affordable and quality healthcare, will all be disrupted and transformed beyond our imagination.

At the same time, few private companies are monopolizing data, privacy and cyber security fears are real, fake news and deep fakes are starting to impact societies, and there is real fear of AI moving at a speed beyond what policy makers can deal with. We must, therefore, be cognizant of these and deliberately plan policies and technology to minimize harm.

Let me tell you a bit about India and how connectivity, data, and AI are starting to play out at scale. 

From having to wait 5 years to get a phone connection in the late 90s, India now has more than a billion mobile phone users, about half a billion smartphone users, 600 plus million Internet users, and has the cheapest data plans in the world! 

India, in the last decade, has also invested in building India Stack, a set of digital building blocks from Identity to Digital Signature, to Electronic Payments, and others. This rapid digitization is resulting in massive amounts of data being generated. 

Hence dealing with data and AI driven innovation was not an option, it was a necessity. India’s Personal data protection and empowerment bill will ensure personal data is not only protected but also everyone has access to all their digital footprints. 

Like the way we created policies and digital infrastructure for connectivity, we are creating data policies and data infrastructure. Our aim is complete data portability and privacy preserving data exchange. We are democratizing access to data, where neither large companies nor Government can monopolize data, but individuals and innovators are empowered with data.

I want to end with this. Imagine you have all the power in the world. What policy and technology infrastructure would you bring in to create a privacy preserving, democratized, data driven AI economy? What would you do to ensure an AI driven economy brings inclusion and human empowerment rather than exclusion and harm?

Thank you!
